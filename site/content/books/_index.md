    heading1: Manon Mouland
    para1: "MANON MOULAND is an artist who grew up in The Eastern Townships of Quebec, raised by a single Dad. Her longing for a larger family creates a confounding rootlessness and contributes to her insecurity. When her father dies she learns that she does indeed have family when a second cousin shows up at his funeral. He becomes the object of her misguided love as she later learns he is actually her half brother."
    para2: "The story is set in Quebec, New York and Connecticut and follows Manon through her mid-twenties, during major changes in her life. She is transformed over this period by experiencing some of her greatest sorrows and fulfilling her greatest dreams. From small town loner and frustrated artist to a recognized talent and philanthropist, and she is embraced by a new acquired family. Readers glimpse into the mind of an artist, experience her passions, and see how Manon, with a cast of characters around her, including several lovers, emerges as a grounded and confident woman."
    para3: Bending genres of romance, women’s fiction and commercial fiction, this is a twist on the ‘male quest’ story. Scenes are painted with rich description, placing the reader into the spaces that Manon occupies. The story is laced with references to art, enriching the reader with an appreciation of it from an artist’s point of view. 
    para4: Like Emily Urquhart’s homage to her father in *The Age of Creativity* and Margaret Atwood’s coming of age story about an artist in *Cat’s Eye*, *Manon Mouland* illuminates the process of making art and exposes the artist’s soul.

    heading2: Sophie's Sophistication
    para5: SOPHIE’S SOPHISTICATION is a contemporary novel with elements as bizarre as the obsession of HH Humbert in Lolita; the pathos of Philip Carey in Of Human Bondage; the nymphomaniacal sexuality of Sabina in Delta of Venus and even the unlikely relationship of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey in Fifty Shades of Grey. Sophie oozes an innocent sensuality that makes her irresistible to male and female readers alike.
