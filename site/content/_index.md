bio:
    text: 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was born in Hungary among a post-war boom of babies. We boomers were cherished as the hope of a future that promised peace and prosperity. After the war, Hungary was assigned to the eastern bloc of countries under Soviet rule and it wasn’t long before Hungarians rebelled and a wave of immigration landed me in Canada.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was lucky enough to have received a good public education and the freedom to become anything I wanted to be. Unfortunately this open-ended potential was too broad to lock me onto any specific path and I spent my twenties trying to ‘find myself’.  I dabbled in art and aesthetics, in design and sales. Finally I dubbed myself an art consultant and built a small business doing corporate and commercial art sales. Apparently this was my calling until my daughter was born, and then what called me was motherhood. 

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn’t until my retirement years that I discovered my true passion ‒ writing. I embraced this pursuit whole heartedly and enrolled at the University of Toronto and went on to earn my Certificate in Creative Writing. My first amateurish attempt at a novel sits securely locked in an archive and serves as a lesson in what not to do as a writer.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the completion of my second novel, and a publication of some of my early short stories, I can legitimately call myself a writer.
